Writing a research paper in security

As a part of my seminar-style course in University of British Columbia, my final term work was writing a research paper in Security.

My research area is using formal methods in order to find security vulnerabilities in Safety critical cyber physical systems.
Hence, I decided to write a short paper in the similar field. However, I would say that a lot of work has been picked up from other papers and from papers by students of my own lab, Dependable systems lab. 

However, while writing the paper, I learnt and realized a lot of things. 

Lesson 1: Reading some one else's lessons are not useful.

Lesson 2: It is important to make mistakes even thought you might know it's a mistake.

Lesson 3: It is very important to defend your topic and why are you chosing it.

Lesson 4: Literature survey is obviously the first step, however, in the first try you are not going to anything extraordinary ( you might, I did not, hence saying), so try to understand your area in depth and make very small minute change to it or not. 

Lesson 5: While writing papers, picking up the provided template really helps. It makes things a lot easier. 

I have attached my term paper. However, I repeat, I have arranged it, however, it is not entirely me.
